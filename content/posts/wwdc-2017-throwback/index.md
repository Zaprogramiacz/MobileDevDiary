## Intro

Welcome reader!

This year WWDC is super close, and I came up with idea to write about my live WWDC experience. I was the luck one who were eligable for Swift Student Challange

## Pixel Balls

What made my submission unique? In my opinion it was:
- pixel art design

- custom pixel font

- unit tests
