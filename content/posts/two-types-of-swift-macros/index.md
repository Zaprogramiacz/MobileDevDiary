### What is macro?

üí° Macro is a feature that generates code during compilation. Unlike macros in C, which work like ‚Äúfind and replace‚Äù, Swift macros are type-safe and context aware, making them powerful tools reducing boilerplate code.

Two types of macros
- attached - use `@` prefix, tied to a declaration adding extra logic to it, like: `@Test`, `@Model`, `@Observable`
- freestanding - use `#` prefix, standalone code that can be invoked independently as a part of the code, like `#expect`, `#Predicate`, `#warning`

Example of attached macro ‚§µÔ∏è
```swift
@Test func addition() { // tied to the declaration
    ...
}
```

Example of freestanding macro ‚§µÔ∏è
```swift
@Test func addition() {
    #require(1 + 2 == 3) // not attached to a declaration
}
```

### Bonus
It‚Äôs possible to expand macros, especially those defined by you, and check their implementation by right-clicking on a macro and selecting the "Expand Macro" option. ‚§µÔ∏è
